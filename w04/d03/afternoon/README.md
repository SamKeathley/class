# Workshop - StarCraft (Mongoose Expansion)

> This is an outline for you to begin taking your own notes on how the application in today's lesson is put together from start to finish. 

## What's Being Built?

We're going to develop an application that allows us to both see and add units for the three races within [StarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc/).

[List of StarCraft Units](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_StarCraft_II_units)

## Create a Remote mLab Database

1. Create an account on [mLab](https://mlab.com/) if you don't already have one
2. Create a new sandbox database 
3. Create a new database user
4. Take note of the connection string given to us for later
