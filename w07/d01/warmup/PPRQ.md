# Post Project Retrospective Questionaire

Working with a group can be a demanding process, both technically and collaboratively. Like most post-sprint workflows, we would like you complete the questionaire below to reflect on the experience. 

**Why**: Developers also typically find themselves working in small groups, it is therefore imperative to start honing the skills necessary to work well in this setting. 

Reflecting back on last weeks project, take a moment to reflect how **YOU** worked technically and collboratively with your group:

1. What's one thing you would like to continue doing in your next project?

2. What's one thing you will stop doing in your next project?

3. What is one thing you would like to start doing in your next project?
